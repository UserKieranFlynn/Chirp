## SECTION B




### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

Our proposed project idea is to create a mobile application that will provide audio updates about major sporting events from the social media website Twitter. This cross platform application will allow users to have audio played through their device from their favourite sources about the events sport, and allow journalists & fans to record audio updates for the event they wish to provide coverage of. 

### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

The project at its’ core is a mobile application that allows a user to select certain Twitter profiles that they follow, and for a set period of time listen to tweets from them in real time. The profile’s doing the tweeting will use the application to record their message, and a link to the recording (which is in cloud storage) will be tweeted out. When the link appears in the original user’s application feed the audio recording will be played.

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

The idea was one that was suggested by Dr. Stephen Blott on his website. As we both have interests in sporting events such as the Rugby World Cup, the Olympic Games and the UEFA Champions League, we felt it would be a worthwhile project idea to pursue. And from a more technical view, Kieran gained experience on INTRA with working on applications linking Sharepoint & Powerapps. As a result, the idea of pursuing a mobile application for the final year project was the perfect route to go down. In saying that, as more details on the process of the final year project came out, it became clear that developing simply an android app may not be enough. As a result, we decided to expand the scope of the idea to also include an iOS version of the application.

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? 

* A way to listen to tweet updates of any event / occasion that you’re interested in.
* Provide the choice of sources from which the updates will be provided. 
The ability to record audio updates that will be stored in the cloud. 
* Means to have a link between the cloud storage and the Twitter API to have audio tweeted from your Twitter account.


> Who will the users be?

Because the application hooks directly in to Twitter, the userbase will consist of anyone with a twitter account or with the opportunity to make one. Within this group of twitter users is a massive range of people from different locations, backgrounds, ages and interests. One of the unique aspects of the project is that, although it’s primarily aimed at sporting events, the context of the tweet is actually irrelevant to how it fundamentally functions. Because of this it could be used for any event, activity, conference or seminar. 

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

* Useful for occasions where you’re busy /commuting / in another situation where reading text is not feasible. 
* It allows for more information to be conveyed at once compared to a single tweet (which have character limits)
* It prevents controversy of a tweet due to lack of context and tone. 
* It allows for a more personal connection with the user who is conveying their ideas
* Users with visual impairments may have trouble reading small text 
* Provide more accessible platform for updates for irregular social media users.


### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

The programming languages we intend to use in the development of this application include the following; 

 * Swift
 * Java
 * React JS
 * JSON
 * Typescript


### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

The tools we intend to use in the development of the application include the following; 

 * Android Studio
 * XCode
 * Google Drive / Dropbox
 * Twitter API
 * JUnit
 * Quick/Nimble (Swift Unit Testing Framework)


### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

Android operating system based mobile device

Apple device with iOS operating system


### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

 * App Development (IOS / Android)
 * Working with the twitter API
 * Automating storing /removing files within cloud storage.
 * Further develop front end development skills with React
 * Programming on Mac OS using Swift


### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.

Although the functionality of both the Android and iOS versions of the application are the same, we decided to split the two versions between us and each take one. Kieran will mostly be focusing on the iOS version of the application whereas Eoin will concentrate on the Android version. 

Within this split we will also each take responsibility for specific tasks within the overall application(s) that are listed below.


#### Student 1

__Name:__ __Kieran__ __Flynn__

__ID:__ __16334663__

I will be the lead developer of the iOS version of the application. It will be my responsibility to integrate the Twitter API into the Swift program and ensure that the features of the application can be correctly implemented while remaining consistent with the Android version developed by Eoin. 

In terms of features to be developed, I will take the lead on investigating the following application features; 

 * Authorisation of log in through user twitter account.
 * Uploading of recording to cloud storage
 * Integrate media player into the application
 * “Go Live” Function to listen in on selected users
 * Select users to listen to
 * Playing audio recording
 * Unit and Design testing of iOS application


#### Student 2

__Name:__ __Eoin O'Brien__

__ID:__ __15324971__

I will be taking charge of the Android application’s development. It will be my responsibility to ensure that the Android application functions similarly to the iOS version developed by Kieran. 

Below are the tasks that I will be taking charge of implementing.

* Record Tweet using Device microphone
* Design of the application graphical user interface
* Tweet out link to recording (with optional text included)
* Pick specific duration / time frame to listen for
* Tweets containing link to recording pushed to application feed
* Replayability functionality
* Unit and Design testing of Android Application

### Collaboration between both students.

The following activities will be performed by both team members in a collaborative effort with one another; 

* Creation of the documentation required as part of the project
* Organisation of Academic Presentations
* Maintenance of GitLab repository
* Recording and editing of application video walkthrough
* Conduction of User Testing of application
* Conduction of feedback meetings between team members and/or supervisor
